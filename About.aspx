    <p  class="jumbotron"> A2Z was founded as a grocery trading store on March 1, 1938, by Lee Byung-Chull. He started his business in Taegu, Korea, trading
        noodles and other goods produced in and around the city and exporting them to China and its provinces. (The company name, Samsung, came
        from the Korean for “three stars.”) After the Korean War, Lee expanded his business into textiles and opened the largest woolen mill in Korea.
        He focused heavily on industrialization with the goal of helping his country redevelop itself after the war. During that period his business benefited 
        from the new protectionist policies adopted by the Korean government, whose aim was to help large domestic conglomerates (chaebol) by shielding them from
        competition and providing them easy financing. In the late 1950s the company acquired three of Korea’s largest commercial banks as well as an insurance company 
        and firms that made cement and fertilizer.
        Samsung in the 1960s acquired more insurance companies as well as an oil refinery, a nylon company, and a department store.</p>
